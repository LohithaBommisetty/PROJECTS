# PROJECTS
Welcome to my Arduino Embedded Projects repository! This collection features my personal projects built with Arduino microcontrollers. As a beginner in electronics and programming, I've created these projects to explore Arduino's capabilities. I'm excited to share my journey and the knowledge I've gained along the way!
